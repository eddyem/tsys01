Two sensors were glued by termoconducting paste to piece of glass. After that wrapped by two layers of thick "warm floor" substrate.
Logger measured their temperatures every second.

FILES:

log - raw logged data. First column - UNIX time, second and third - T0 and T1 respectively.
temp_avg100.png - moving average over 100 values
temp_avg.png - moving average over 30 values
temp_diffs.png - differences between raw temperatures and their moving averages
temp.png - scattered plot of raw T0 and T1
temp_t1-t0_avg100.png - differences of moving averages over 100 (T1 - T0)
temp_t1-t0.png - differences of raw temperatures (T1 - T0)
