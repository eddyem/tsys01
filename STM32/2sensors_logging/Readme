Example for STM32F042 nucleo working with TSYS-01 temperature sensor.
Check temperature on two sensors with different addresses and show values by USART.
USART speed 115200.

Serial interface commands (ends with '\n'):

- **C** show coefficients for both thermosensors
- **R** reset both
- **I** reinit I2C
- **T** get temperature
